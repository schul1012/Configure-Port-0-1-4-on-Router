I got this task via email.

I launched the browser, went to the browser history and selected the IP address for the router, which is 192.168.45.1<br/>

After logging in with the admin credentials, I clicked on the ports tab. There are four. <br/>

I checked the detailed task requirements. I have to open Port 4 and then assign 10.175.35.1 as its IP and /23 as subnet mask to it.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
I decided to go to the home page of the browser and then a forum.<br/>

<br/>

<p align="center">
There was a forum thread about calculating the subnet mask. I know the basics of subnetting, but I wanted to check it anyway for demonstration purposes of this simulator.

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
There was some detailed explantion about subnetting at the top of the thread, but I scrolled down and found one user saying that it's not practical to calculate it manually every time at work and suggesting to use a website that calculates it for me.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
Once I click on the link, I encounter a webpage that looks like https://jodies.de/ipcalc in real life. All I had to do was just enter the IP address and netmask. It also calculates and shows other things that might be useful.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<p align="center">
I went back to the router configuration admin page and filled out the information to open the port.<br/>
